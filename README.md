# Vet Clinic Database

> This repository contains relational database with data about: animals, animals' owners, clinic employees, visits to create the data structure for a vet clinic.


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- [schema.sql](./schema.sql) for creating all tables.
- [data.sql](./data.sql) for populating tables with sample data.
- [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
